Online Training Management System
This system serves as a centralized, web-based platform to facilitate, manage, and track employee training and development initiatives within an organization. It streamlines the entire training lifecycle, from program selection and multi-stage approvals to attendance tracking, feedback collection, and performance analysis, ensuring a structured approach to workforce upskilling.

Key User Roles:

Employee: Applies for training programs.
Reporting Officer (RO): Direct supervisor, initiates or approves training requests.
Head of Department (HOD): Departmental lead, reviews and approves training requests.
HR Department (HR): Manages programs, handles final approvals, and administers training.
Business Unit Head (BUH): Senior management, provides final approval for training requests.
Core Modules & Functionality:
1. Employee Portal:
* Program Browse & Selection: Employees can browse an updated catalog of available training programs, viewing details such as course description, duration, prerequisites, and schedule.
* Application Submission: Employees can select desired programs and submit formal training applications through a user-friendly interface.
* Status Tracking: Employees have real-time visibility into the status of their submitted applications, understanding at which stage of the approval process their request currently stands (e.g., pending RO approval, pending HOD approval, pending HR review, pending BUH approval).

2. Multi-Stage Approval Workflow:
The system implements a robust, hierarchical approval process, dynamically routing applications based on the initiator and current status. An automated email notification is triggered to the employee upon final approval.

* **Employee-Initiated Workflow:**
    * Employee submits a training request.
    * **Reporting Officer (RO) Review:** The employee's respective RO receives a notification and can **Approve or Reject** the application.
    * **Head of Department (HOD) Review:** If the RO approves, the request is forwarded to the employee's HOD, who can then **Approve or Reject** it.
    * **HR Department Approval:** If the HOD approves, the request moves to the HR Department for final review and **Approval or Rejection**.
    * **Business Unit Head (BUH) Approval:** If HR approves, the request proceeds to the respective BUH for the ultimate **Approval or Rejection**.
    * **Final Trigger:** Upon **BUH approval**, an automated email notification is triggered to the employee, confirming their enrollment.

* **Reporting Officer (RO)-Initiated Workflow:**
    * A Reporting Officer can directly select and initiate a training program application for an employee under their supervision.
    * The request then follows the subsequent approval chain: **HOD -> HR -> BUH**.
    * **Final Trigger:** Upon **BUH approval**, an automated email notification is triggered to the employee.

* **Head of Department (HOD)-Initiated Workflow:**
    * A HOD can directly select and initiate a training program application for an employee within their department.
    * **Auto-Approval at HOD Stage:** For HOD-initiated requests, the HOD's approval is automatically granted (effectively bypassing the RO stage for that request's approval chain).
    * The request then proceeds for further approval: **HR -> BUH**.
    * **Final Trigger:** Upon **BUH approval**, an automated email notification is triggered to the employee.
3. HR Administration & Program Management:
This module provides HR personnel with comprehensive tools to manage all aspects of training programs and system users.
* Program Master Data Management: HR can Upload, Edit, and Delete training program data, ensuring the program catalog is always current.
* Access & HR Admin Permission Control: Granular control over user roles and permissions, defining who can perform which actions (e.g., who can approve at each stage, who can manage program data).
* Training Status Dashboards: HR can view aggregated and detailed statuses of all training programs:
* Pending Status: Track programs at every stage of the approval pipeline, identifying bottlenecks (e.g., pending RO, HOD, HR, or BUH approval).
* Approved Status: View all programs that have received final approval.
* Rejected Status: Access a record of all rejected applications, often with reasons for rejection.

4. Training Attendance Management (HR Functionality):
* A dedicated interface allows HR administrators to meticulously fill and track day-wise attendance for each training program. This ensures accurate record-keeping for compliance and program effectiveness analysis.

5. Training Feedback System (Employee Functionality):
* Upon completion of a training program, employees can access a dedicated feedback form.
* This form allows them to provide ratings and detailed comments on various aspects of the training, such as content, instructor quality, relevance, and logistics.

6. Reporting & Analytics Dashboard:
* The system offers an intuitive dashboard with an overall training program graph-wise view.
* This allows HR and management to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) through visual representations like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs, showing:
* Number of applications by program/department.
* Approval/rejection rates.
* Completion rates.
* Training expenditure.
* Feedback scores and trends.

7. Training Resource Repository:
* A centralized module where all employees can view training feedback documents, potentially in PDF format. This transparency allows employees to review the effectiveness and reception of past programs, aiding them in making informed decisions about future training choices.
